=== Baseline Access Control Policy ===

Purpose:
This policy defines user roles, groups, and access privileges for a small secure team.

Roles & Groups:
1. Admin (sysadmin)
   - Users: alice
   - Privileges: limited sudo for system/user management
   - Commands: useradd, userdel, passwd, apt-get, systemctl

2. Developer (project)
   - Users: bob, carol
   - Privileges: write access to /srv/project
   - No sudo access

3. Auditor (auditor)
   - Users: dave
   - Privileges: read-only on /srv/project
   - No sudo, home directories locked (chmod 700)

Shared Resource Policy:
- /srv/project owned by root:project
- ACL: project group (rwx), others (read-only)
- setgid bit ensures new files inherit group ownership

Auditing:
- Manual audit log tracks changes in /etc/sudoers and /etc/passwd
- Log file: /var/log/manual_audit.log

Compliance:
- No world-writable system directories
- All sudo rules least-privilege
